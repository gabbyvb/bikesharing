## Summary 
Overall investing in the Bike Sharing program would be good for Des Moines. The bikes provide an alternative modes of transportation for users to use when traveling to and from work. It also provides a nice leisure on the weekend. The bikes are more heavily used by males so the charging stations should be placed in strategic areas to maximize this opportunity.

To continue this analysis, I would want to see:
1. An age breakout of users
2. The average distance a user travels
